# RAG Studio - Implementation Status

**Date**: September 26, 2025
**Branch**: `5-epic-4-tools-flows-foundation`
**Status**: ✅ **Phase 1-4 Complete** + Model Management System + Ready for Phase 5

## 📊 Current State

| Component | Status | Test Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Core Backend** | ✅ Complete | 86.8% (46/53) | All services integrated |
| **Frontend (Angular)** | ✅ Complete | Build: 993KB | NgRx Signal Stores |
| **Model Management** | ⚠️ Backend Only | 100% (9/9) | UI integration needed |
| **Pipeline System** | ⚠️ Designer Only | Mock API | Real execution missing |
| **KB System** | ⚠️ Overlaps Pipelines | Has duplicated ETL | Integration required |
| **Build System** | ✅ Stable | Zero errors | Rust + Angular compiling |

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Infrastructure ✅
- **Database**: SQLite split (app_meta.db + events.db) with Diesel ORM
- **Vector Search**: LanceDB + BM25 hybrid with graceful fallback
- **Storage**: LocalFS with quotas (1-5GB), ZIP packs, SHA-256 checksums
- **Cache**: Memory TTL with dashmap, specialized cache types
- **State**: StateManager pattern with StateDelta mutations
- **Python AI**: Subprocess isolation with embedding worker

### Service Architecture ✅
```
Manager (DI Root)
├── SqlService (async WAL, migrations)
├── VectorDbService (LanceDB + BM25 fallback)
├── StorageService (quotas, ZIP packs)
├── CacheService (TTL, LRU eviction)
├── ModelService (dynamic registry, LRU cache)
├── EmbeddingService (subprocess communication)
└── StateManager (canonical state management)
```

## 🎯 Completed Phases

### Phase 1-2: Core Backend + Knowledge Base ✅
- **Database**: SQLite + LanceDB hybrid with migration system
- **KB Module**: Hybrid search (vector + BM25), mandatory citations, versioning
- **MCP Server**: Subprocess isolation, JSON-RPC, kb.* tools
- **API**: 8 Tauri commands for complete KB operations

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration ✅
- **NgRx Signals**: Migrated to Signal Store pattern, removed service layer
- **Real-time Features**: Event-driven state sync, live performance monitoring
- **Dashboard**: Live metrics, health monitoring, activity stream
- **Settings System**: Complete CRUD operations, MCP server control

### Phase 4: Tools & Pipelines ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE**
- **Tools Management**: ✅ NgRx Signal Store, CRUD operations, testing interface
- **Import/Export**: ✅ .ragpack format, bulk operations, template system
- **Pipeline Designer**: ✅ Visual builder, ETL configuration UI
- **Pipeline Execution**: ❌ Mock API only, real execution missing
- **Model Integration**: ❌ No dynamic model selection in pipelines

## 🚨 Critical Architectural Issues

### KB-Pipeline Overlap Problem
- **Duplicate ETL Logic**: Both KB creation and Pipelines handle data ingestion
- **Model Selection**: KB creation wizard doesn't use ModelService
- **Template Conflicts**: Separate template systems for KB vs Pipeline
- **Error Handling**: Duplicated error handling across systems

### Dependency Chain Blocking
```
Model UI → Pipeline Execution → KB Integration → Flows
   ❌           ❌                    ❌          🚫
```

### Impact Analysis
- **Code Duplication**: ~40% overlap in ETL functionality
- **Maintenance Burden**: Two separate ingestion systems to maintain
- **User Confusion**: Different interfaces for similar operations
- **Technical Debt**: Architecture inconsistency blocks Phase 5

## 🧪 Test Coverage

| Component | Tests | Pass Rate | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Core Backend** | 53 total | 86.8% (46/53) | ✅ Stable |
| **Model Management** | 9 total | 100% (9/9) | ✅ Complete |
| **Expected Failures** | 7 tests | - | 6 LanceDB + 1 helper |
| **Angular Build** | - | 100% | ✅ 993KB bundle |
| **Tauri Commands** | 37 total | 100% | ✅ All functional |

## 🚧 Known Issues

### 1. KB-Pipeline Architectural Overlap (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Duplicate ETL functionality causing maintenance burden
- **Impact**: Blocks Phase 5 implementation, creates technical debt
- **Resolution Required**: Integrate KB creation into Pipeline system
- **Timeline**: Must resolve before Flow implementation

### 2. Pipeline Execution Engine Missing (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Pipeline Designer has mock API, no real execution
- **Impact**: Pipelines don't actually run, blocking KB integration
- **Resolution Required**: Implement real ETL execution engine
- **Dependencies**: Model Management UI for dynamic model selection

### 3. Model Management Frontend Gap (HIGH)
- **Issue**: ModelService backend complete, no UI integration
- **Impact**: Blocks dynamic model selection in Pipelines and KB
- **Resolution Required**: Complete Models page and selector components
- **Timeline**: 1 week implementation needed

### 4. LanceDB Arrow Compatibility (LOW)
- **Issue**: Arrow version mismatch (LanceDB 54.x vs project 50.x)
- **Status**: ⚠️ Expected failures in 6 tests
- **Workaround**: Graceful fallback to BM25 implementation
- **Priority**: Background monitoring, not blocking development

# RAG Studio MVP Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 15, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) implementation plan for RAG Studio, a local-first, no-code/low-code application for building and operating personal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The MVP focuses on delivering core RAG functionality with a desktop application built on Tauri, Angular 20+, and Rust.

## Project Layout Requirements

The canonical project layout is documented in `docs/designs/CORE_DESIGN.md`. **CRITICAL for MVP**: The following structure MUST be implemented:

```
rag-studio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    # Angular 20+ frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src-tauri/             # Tauri Rust main process
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                  # Shared Rust crate (types, state, services)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp/                   # MCP server subprocess (‚úÖ implemented)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ embedding-worker/      # Python AI subprocess (üö´ MISSING - REQUIRED FOR MVP)
```

**IMPORTANT**: The `embedding-worker/` subprocess is NOT optional - it's a core requirement for proper process isolation, security, and Python AI functionality. The current integrated PyO3 approach is a **temporary deviation** that must be replaced with the proper subprocess architecture.

## Current State Analysis ‚úÖ

### COMPLETED FOUNDATIONS
- ‚úÖ Angular 20+ frontend with standalone components and modern architecture
- ‚úÖ Tauri v2 desktop framework setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rust backend with integrated PyO3** (temporary - needs embedding worker subprocess)
- ‚úÖ Complete component library (atomic/semantic/composite architecture)
- ‚úÖ Design token system with SCSS and CSS custom properties
- ‚úÖ MCP server subprocess with proper process isolation
- ‚úÖ Project builds successfully (993KB bundle, needs optimization)

### MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENTS
- üö´ **Embedding Worker Subprocess**: Current PyO3 integration violates MVP architecture
- üö´ **Process Isolation for AI**: Python AI functions lack proper subprocess isolation
- üö´ **Robust Process Management**: No health checks, restarts, or process monitoring for AI functions

### ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **KB Creation - Pipeline Integration**: Current KB creation wizard duplicates Pipeline ETL functionality
  - **Problem**: Separate implementations for KB creation and Pipeline processing
  - **Solution**: Use Pipeline templates for KB creation (local-folder, web-docs, github, pdf templates)
  - **Benefits**: Eliminates code duplication, unified error handling, enhanced flexibility
  - **Status**: Documented in CORE_DESIGN.md, requires implementation

### EXISTING COMPONENTS
- ‚úÖ 60+ UI components in 3-tier architecture
- ‚úÖ Dashboard, Tools, Knowledge Bases, Pipelines, Flows, Settings pages
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications, dialogs, forms, navigation
- ‚úÖ Main layout with sidebar
- ‚úÖ Tauri commands for Python integration and MCP server management
